Here is a table of the numbers for the box plot plus the mean cost for the apartments. 


## Conclusion

It is interesting to note the difference between the two genders apartment cost. As you can see all of the statistics for the male housing are lower than the female.It would be interesting to see if the difference was because girls apartments are generally nicer than guys or if guys just get cheaper apartments regardless of the estimated price.
